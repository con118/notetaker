# Express Note Taker Overview

The Express.js note-taking web app is a simple yet powerful application that allows users to create, view, update, and delete notes. The app has a clean and easy-to-use interface that allows users to manage their notes effortlessly. It is built using the Express.js framework, which is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js.

## How It Works

To create a new note, click on the "New Note" button on the app's homepage. This will take you to a new page where you can enter the title and content of your note. Once you're done, click on the "Save" button to save your note. The app will redirect you to the homepage, where you can see a list of all your notes.

Viewing a Note:

Updating a Note:
To update a note, click on the note's title on the homepage to view its details. Once you're on the note's details page, click on the "Edit" button.

Deleting a Note:
